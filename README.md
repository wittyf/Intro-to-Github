# Introduction
#### Disclaimer

# CRISP-DM Methodology
This project follows the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, published in 1999 to standardize data mining processes across industries. CRISP-DM is the most common methodology for data mining, analytics, and data science projects.

**Key Principle:** *"The sequence of the phases is not rigid. Moving back and forth between different phases is always required. The outcome of each phase determines which phase, or particular task of a phase, has to be performed next."*

# Key CRISP-DM Principles Applied

1. **Iterative Process**: This project embraces the non-rigid sequence of phases, moving back and forth as needed
2. **Business Focus**: Every technical decision traces back to business objectives
3. **Documentation**: Each phase produces specific deliverables and documentation
4. **Quality Focus**: Emphasis on data quality and thorough evaluation
5. **Practical Deployment**: Consideration of real-world implementation from project start
